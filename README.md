# Medjed Assembly

This repository contains the PCB files of the [MEDJED Maskless lithography system](https://github.com/openMLA/Medjed). PCB files are generated with KiCAD

Note that the [Wiki](https://github.com/openMLA/Medjed/wiki) and [Discussions](https://github.com/openMLA/Medjed/discussions) for the project are located in the main Medjed repository.

### Organisation

This repository should generally be obtained as a submodule of the main Medjed repository. That other repository will also have code and CAD files for the project.
